## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd

### Added
- **Domain-Driven Design Core Components**:
  - Enhanced `BaseEntity` with invariant validation system
  - Improved `AggregateRoot` class for domain event handling and invariant enforcement
  - Extended `IAggregateRoot` interface with versioning and boundary enforcement methods
  - Added `DomainValidationException` for domain invariant violations
  - Implemented thread-safe domain event handling
  - Created comprehensive documentation of DDD core components
  - Added new `SoftDeleteAggregateRoot` class combining soft delete capability with aggregate root behavior
  - Created domain events for soft deletion operations
  - Added `Address` value object for customer shipping information
- **Entity Auditing System**:
  - Enhanced architecture with interfaces for separation of concerns
  - `IAuditableEntity` interface for tracking entity changes (creation/modification timestamps and users)
  - `ISoftDelete` interface for entities that support soft deletion
  - `SoftDeleteEntity` base class implementing soft-delete functionality
  - `ICurrentUserService` and implementation to capture the current user for auditing
- **Repository Enhancements**:
  - Specialized repositories for soft-delete entities (`ISoftDeleteRepository<T>`)
  - EF Core extensions for working with soft-deleted entities
  - Global query filters to automatically exclude soft-deleted entities
- **Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive documentation on the entity auditing approach and implementation
  - Added new documentation for DDD core components and invariant validation system

### Changed
- **Code Organization**:
  - Restructured domain layer for better DDD alignment (renamed "Entities" folder to "Aggregates")
  - Created new folder structure (DomainServices, Rules, Shared) with appropriate subdirectories
  - Updated namespaces from `SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain.Entities` to `SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain.Aggregates`
  - Refactored user service code to its own folder under Infrastructure/Services/User for better organization
  - Separated `Customer` entity and its events into distinct files (`Customer.cs` and `CustomerEvents.cs`)
  - Moved `Entity` class from Entities namespace to Common/Base for better architectural consistency
  - Moved `IAggregateRoot` interface from Common/Base to Common/Interfaces for consistent placement of interfaces
- **Domain Events**:
  - Improved domain event class readability with more descriptive property names and documentation
  - Standardized inheritance patterns across all domain event classes
  - Renamed properties in `SkillUpdatedEvent` for consistency with other update events (`SkillName` â†’ `OldName`)
  - Enhanced XML documentation for event properties to better explain their purpose and context
  - Introduced more specific domain events for tracking state changes (`SkillDifficultyChangedEvent`, `SkillCategoryChangedEvent`)
- **Domain Layer Architecture**:
  - Clarified relationship between `Entity` and `AggregateRoot` classes
  - Standardized method for implementing domain event handling across all aggregates
  - Added implementation of `Apply` pattern for consistent event handling
  - Improved implementation of `CheckInvariants` across domain entities
- **Entity Framework Implementation**:
  - Updated `BaseEntity` to implement `IAuditableEntity` interface
  - Modified `ApplicationDbContext` to handle soft deletes and fetch current user information
  - Refactored audit property settings to use the current user service

### Fixed
- **Security & Data Integrity**:
  - Fixed hardcoded "system" user in auditing data by implementing proper user context resolution

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-01

### Added
- Initial project setup with Clean Architecture structure
- Domain layer with base entities and common interfaces
- Infrastructure layer with repositories and DbContext
- Application layer with basic CQRS setup
- API layer with basic configuration
- Unit tests structure for each layer
