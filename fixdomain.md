Phase 1: Create Shared Kernel and Move Core Types

Create Common Project:
Create a new .NET Class Library project named SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common within the src directory.
Target the appropriate .NET version (e.g., net9.0).
Move Result Types:
Move the files defining IResult, Result, and Result<T> (currently in SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain/Common/Models/) to a new folder SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common/.
Update the namespaces in these files to SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common.
Move Error Type:
Move the file defining Error (currently SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain/Common/Error.cs) to a new folder SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common/.
Update the namespace in this file to SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common.
Update Project References:
Add a project reference from SoftwareEngineerSkills.Application to SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common.
Add a project reference from SoftwareEngineerSkills.Infrastructure to SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common.
Add a project reference from SoftwareEngineerSkills.API to SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common.
Crucially: Ensure SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain does NOT reference SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common.
Update using Statements:
Globally search and replace using SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain.Common.Models; with using SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common; in the Application, Infrastructure, and API projects.
Globally search and replace using SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain.Common; (or specific error usings) with using SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common; where the Error type is used.

Phase 3: Refactor Domain and Application Interaction

Refactor Domain Entity Methods (Dummy.cs):
Go through methods like Create, Update, Activate, Deactivate in Dummy.cs.
Change their return types:
Create: Result<Dummy> -> Dummy
Update, Activate, Deactivate: Result -> void
Remove all return Result.Success(...) statements.
Replace return Result.Failure(...) statements with throw new YourSpecificDomainException(...). Use existing exceptions like DummyDomainException or create more specific ones inheriting from DomainException if needed.
Refactor Application Handlers:
Identify Application layer Command Handlers that call the modified Domain methods (e.g., CreateDummyCommandHandler, UpdateDummyCommandHandler, etc.).
Wrap the calls to the Domain entity methods (e.g., Dummy.Create(...), dummyInstance.Update(...)) within try-catch blocks.
Catch the specific DomainException types thrown in step 7.
In the catch blocks, translate the caught exception into a Result.Failure using the exception details. Example: catch (DummyDomainException ex) { return Result.Failure<Guid>(DummyErrors.SomeError(ex.Message)); } (You might need to define static error types like DummyErrors for consistency).
Ensure the handlers still correctly return Result or Result<T> upon successful execution (after the try block).

Phase 4: Verification

Build Solution: Perform a full solution build to catch any compilation errors missed during refactoring.
Run Tests: Execute all unit and integration tests. Fix any failures caused by the refactoring. Pay close attention to tests verifying error handling and return types from Application handlers.
This plan breaks down the work into logical phases, starting with structural changes and then addressing the behavioral changes required by the architectural guidelines.
