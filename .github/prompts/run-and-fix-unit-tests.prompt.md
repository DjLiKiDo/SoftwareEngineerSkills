Execute all unit tests and address any failures found, following these steps:

1. Run the unit test suite in Visual Studio Code
2. If any tests fail:
   - Review test failures and error messages
   - Fix test implementation issues without modifying application code
   - Re-run tests to verify fixes

3. Once all tests pass:
   - Generate and analyze code coverage report
   - Identify untested code paths or scenarios
   - Add missing test cases to achieve adequate coverage
   - Follow standard unit testing best practices:
     - One assertion per test
     - Clear test naming
     - Proper test isolation
     - Meaningful test data

4. Document any test modifications in code comments

Note: Focus on improving test quality and coverage while preserving existing application functionality, unless tge changes are necessary to fix the tests and improves the implementation
