Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the domain layer within the codebase, focusing on:

1. Domain model clarity and correctness:
   - Entity relationships and aggregates
   - Business rules and invariants
   - Value objects vs entities separation

2. Design patterns implementation:
   - Domain-Driven Design principles adherence
   - SOLID principles application 
   - Tactical patterns usage (factories, repositories, services)

3. Code quality metrics:
   - Coupling between domain objects
   - Cohesion within aggregates
   - Business logic encapsulation
   - Domain event handling

4. Technical debt assessment:
   - Code duplication in domain logic
   - Business rule violations
   - Outdated modeling patterns

Deliverables:
- Prioritized list of improvement opportunities
- Impact assessment for each finding
- Refactoring recommendations with concrete examples
- Risk analysis for suggested changes

Consider both immediate optimizations and long-term architectural improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

Write the analysis as markdown on the file '.DomainAnalysis.md' in the root of the repository.
