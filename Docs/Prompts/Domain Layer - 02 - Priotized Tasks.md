Task Prioritization for SoftwareEngineerSkills Project
After reviewing your project's current state, I recommend prioritizing tasks in the following order based on architectural importance, dependencies, and impact:

High Priority (Foundation)
Implement Core Domain Layer Components

Create base classes (BaseEntity, ValueObject, AggregateRoot)
Implement IAggregateRoot interface to clearly identify aggregate boundaries
Implement domain invariants with CheckInvariants/EnforceInvariants pattern
These are foundational and other tasks depend on them
Complete Entity Auditing System

Implement the interfaces for separation of concerns (ICreationAuditable, IModificationAuditable)
Implement ISoftDelete interface for soft deletion functionality
Update CHANGELOG.md to document these changes
Repository Pattern Implementation

Finalize Repository and UnitOfWork interfaces and implementations
Implement specialized repositories for soft-delete entities
Add global query filters for soft-deleted entities
Medium Priority (Enhancement)
Implement Result Pattern

Create Result classes for exception-free error handling
Integrate with your existing code patterns
Enhance Value Objects

Create value objects for domain concepts currently using primitives
Ensure proper immutability
Improve Domain Event System

Implement typed domain events using generics
Add metadata to events
Ensure proper event handling
Lower Priority (Refinement)
Implement Domain Specifications

Extract business rules to specification classes
Refactor existing validation logic to use specifications
Add Policy-Based Entity Access Control

Implement IEntityWithAccessControl interface
Apply to entities that need access control
Complete IOptions Pattern Implementation

Finish standardizing settings with section names
Add validation for critical settings
Implement IOptionsMonitor for configuration that may change
Documentation Tasks (Ongoing)
Update CHANGELOG.md with each significant change
Create/update architecture documentation
Document design decisions and patterns
This prioritization focuses on building a solid foundation first (domain model, persistence) before adding more sophisticated patterns and refinements. It also considers the improvements mentioned in your CHANGELOG.md as being actively worked on.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific area of this prioritization?
