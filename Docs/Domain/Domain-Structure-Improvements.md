## Recommended Structure
```

├── Common/
│   ├── Base/                   <- Base classes stay here

```

This reorganization better reflects Domain-Driven Design concepts:

1. **Aggregates vs Entities**: Changes "Entities" to "Aggregates" to emphasize that these are aggregate roots that manage boundaries
2. **DomainServices**: New folder for domain services that coordinate between aggregates
3. **Rules**: Dedicated space for business rules that can be applied across different aggregates
4. **Shared**: For components shared across different parts of the domain

The goal is to make the structure more explicitly reflect DDD patterns and improve navigability for developers.
