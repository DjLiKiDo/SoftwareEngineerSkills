# Domain Layer Prioritized Tasks

This document outlines the prioritized tasks for implementing the domain layer improvements identified in our analysis.

## Priority 1: Foundation Improvements

These tasks focus on the core building blocks that other improvements will build upon.

### 1.1 Folder Structure Reorganization
- [ ] Create new folder structure according to Domain-Structure-Improvements.md
- [ ] Move files to appropriate locations
- [ ] Update namespaces to reflect new structure
- [ ] Fix project references affected by moves

### 1.2 Domain Exception Hierarchy
- [ ] Create base `DomainException` class
- [ ] Implement specialized exceptions (`BusinessRuleException`, `DomainValidationException`, `EntityNotFoundException`)
- [ ] Update existing code to use the new exception types
- [ ] Create integration tests to verify exception handling

### 1.3 Standardize Base Classes
- [ ] Enhance `BaseEntity` with improved invariant checking
- [ ] Update `AggregateRoot` with thread-safe event handling
- [ ] Implement consistent `CheckInvariants` and `CheckInvariantsAsync` methods
- [ ] Add comprehensive XML documentation

## Priority 2: Domain Event System Improvements

These tasks focus on enhancing the domain event system for better consistency and maintainability.

### 2.1 Event Base Classes
- [ ] Create `PropertyChangedEvent<T>` base class
- [ ] Standardize domain event properties and naming
- [ ] Add versioning to all domain events

### 2.2 Apply Pattern Implementation
- [ ] Implement Apply method in `AggregateRoot` class
- [ ] Update existing aggregates to use Apply pattern
- [ ] Create typed Apply methods for specific events
- [ ] Add tests to verify event application

### 2.3 Event Organization
- [ ] Reorganize event files according to recommendations
- [ ] Standardize event naming across aggregates
- [ ] Update inheritance hierarchy for events

## Priority 3: Value Object Enhancements

These tasks focus on improving value objects to better encapsulate domain concepts.

### 3.1 Value Object Base Implementation
- [ ] Enhance `ValueObject` base class
- [ ] Add immutability patterns with WithX methods
- [ ] Implement comprehensive equality comparisons

### 3.2 Domain-Specific Value Objects
- [ ] Create additional domain-specific value objects
- [ ] Implement validation logic in value object constructors
- [ ] Add domain-specific behavior to value objects
- [ ] Create tests for value object behavior

### 3.3 Replace Primitives with Value Objects
- [ ] Identify primitive properties that should be value objects
- [ ] Create value object replacements
- [ ] Update entity properties to use value objects
- [ ] Update services and handlers to work with value objects

## Priority 4: Documentation and Consistency

These tasks focus on improving documentation and consistency across the domain layer.

### 4.1 XML Documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive XML documentation to public APIs
- [ ] Document complex domain rules and invariants
- [ ] Ensure consistency in documentation style
- [ ] Add examples in documentation where appropriate

### 4.2 Naming Conventions
- [ ] Review and standardize naming across domain layer
- [ ] Ensure consistent prefixes/suffixes for similar concepts
- [ ] Update event names to follow established patterns

### 4.3 Implementation Consistency
- [ ] Review and standardize implementation patterns
- [ ] Ensure consistent property access modifiers (private setters)
- [ ] Standardize collection handling (private field with public read-only access)
- [ ] Ensure consistent constructor patterns

## Priority 5: Entity and Aggregate Refinements

These tasks focus on refining entities and aggregates to better express domain concepts.

### 5.1 Aggregate Boundary Enforcement
- [ ] Review and enforce aggregate boundaries
- [ ] Implement reference mechanisms between aggregates (using IDs)
- [ ] Add invariant validation for aggregate references

### 5.2 Soft Delete Implementation
- [ ] Review and enhance soft delete functionality
- [ ] Create consistent events for soft delete operations
- [ ] Update tests to verify soft delete behavior

### 5.3 Domain Services
- [ ] Identify operations that belong in domain services
- [ ] Create domain service interfaces and implementations
- [ ] Move logic from entities to services where appropriate

## Timeline Estimates

- **Priority 1**: 3-4 days
- **Priority 2**: 2-3 days
- **Priority 3**: 3-4 days
- **Priority 4**: 2-3 days
- **Priority 5**: 3-4 days

Total estimated time: 13-18 days

## Resources Required

- 1-2 Senior developers familiar with DDD principles
- Code review capacity from team leads
- Documentation review capacity

## Dependencies

- Priority 1 tasks should be completed before starting Priority 2
- Priority 2 tasks should be completed before starting Priority 3
- Priorities 4 and 5 can be worked on in parallel after Priorities 1-3

## Success Metrics

- Reduced code complexity (measured by static analysis tools)
- Improved test coverage for domain logic
- Reduced defect rate in domain layer
- Positive feedback from development team on code clarity
- Faster onboarding of new developers
