# Domain Layer Improvement Plan

Based on the thorough code analysis, this document outlines specific improvements for the Domain layer to enhance readability, consistency, and organization.

## 1. Folder Structure Reorganization

Current structure mixes DDD concepts with technical implementations. A clearer DDD-aligned structure:

```
SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain/
├── Aggregates/                 <- Rename from "Entities" for clarity
│   ├── Customer/               <- Customer aggregate
│   └── Skills/                 <- Skill aggregate
├── Common/
│   ├── Base/                   <- Base classes for entities, value objects, etc.
│   ├── Events/                 <- Domain events base classes
│   └── Interfaces/             <- Core interfaces for domain models
├── DomainServices/             <- New folder for domain services
│   └── Interfaces/             <- Domain service interfaces
├── Exceptions/                 <- Domain-specific exceptions
├── Rules/                      <- New folder for business rules
└── ValueObjects/               <- Value objects
```

### Action Items:
- Move repository interfaces from `Abstractions/Persistence` to the Application layer
- Rename `Entities` folder to `Aggregates` to match DDD terminology
- Create a new `DomainServices` folder for cross-aggregate operations
- Create a new `Rules` folder for explicit business rules

## 2. Domain Event Standardization

Events currently vary in naming conventions and property structures, causing inconsistency.

### Action Items:
- Standardize event naming: Use past tense verbs (e.g., `SkillCreated` instead of `SkillCreatedEvent`)
- Consistent property naming: Use the same naming pattern across all events
- Group related events: Events should be organized by their aggregate
- Simplify event properties: Only include necessary data for event consumers

### Example:
```csharp
// Before
public class SkillUpdatedEvent : DomainEvent
{
    public Guid SkillId { get; }
    public string OldName { get; }
    public string NewName { get; }
    public string OldDescription { get; }
    public string NewDescription { get; }
    
    public SkillUpdatedEvent(Guid skillId, string oldName, string newName, 
        string oldDescription, string newDescription)
    {
        SkillId = skillId;
        OldName = oldName;
        NewName = newName;
        OldDescription = oldDescription;
        NewDescription = newDescription;
    }
}

// After - Split into more specific events
public class SkillNameChanged : DomainEvent
{
    public Guid SkillId { get; }
    public string OldName { get; }
    public string NewName { get; }
    
    public SkillNameChanged(Guid skillId, string oldName, string newName)
    {
        SkillId = skillId;
        OldName = oldName;
        NewName = newName;
    }
}

public class SkillDescriptionChanged : DomainEvent
{
    public Guid SkillId { get; }
    public string OldDescription { get; }
    public string NewDescription { get; }
    
    public SkillDescriptionChanged(Guid skillId, string oldDescription, string newDescription)
    {
        SkillId = skillId;
        OldDescription = oldDescription;
        NewDescription = newDescription;
    }
}
```

## 3. Base Class Simplification

The current inheritance hierarchy is complex and could lead to confusion.

### Action Items:
- Reduce inheritance depth
- Consider using composition over inheritance
- Review necessity of certain base classes
- Document clearly when to use each base class

### Example:
```csharp
// Instead of:
// BaseEntity -> Entity -> AggregateRoot
// BaseEntity -> SoftDeleteEntity
// BaseEntity -> Entity -> AggregateRoot -> SoftDeleteAggregateRoot

// Consider:
// BaseEntity -> Entity
// BaseEntity -> AggregateRoot
// And add ISoftDelete as a composition interface
```

## 4. Consistent Validation Strategy

The current model mixes various validation approaches.

### Action Items:
- Standardize validation approach across all domain objects
- Implement consistent invariant checking methods
- Consider using a Result pattern instead of exceptions for expected validation failures
- Define clear validation responsibilities between entities and value objects

## 5. Thread Safety Improvements

### Action Items:
- Review all mutable state for thread safety
- Document thread safety guarantees for each class
- Consider immutable designs where appropriate
- Use concurrent collections where needed

## 6. Domain Services Introduction

### Action Items:
- Identify operations that span multiple aggregates
- Create domain services with clear responsibilities
- Define interfaces for domain services in the domain layer
- Implement services in the application layer

## 7. XML Documentation Consistency

### Action Items:
- Ensure all public members have XML documentation
- Standardize documentation format
- Add examples where appropriate
- Include thread safety notes
- Document invariants and business rules

## 8. Enhanced Domain Events

### Action Items:
- Make all events immutable
- Ensure events contain enough context for consumers
- Consider versioning events for long-term maintainability
- Add Apply() methods to entities for handling events

## 9. Value Object Enhancements

### Action Items:
- Ensure all value objects are truly immutable
- Implement equality consistently
- Add more domain-specific value objects to replace primitive types
- Consider implementing common operators where appropriate

## 10. Domain-Specific Language

### Action Items:
- Review naming to ensure it reflects ubiquitous language
- Replace technical terms with domain terminology where appropriate
- Update documentation to reflect domain terminology
- Ensure consistent terminology across all aggregates
