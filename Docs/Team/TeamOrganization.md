## Work Prioritization and Management

### Priority Levels

All project tasks are categorized into three priority levels:

1. **High Priority**
   - Foundation tasks that other work depends on
   - Must be implemented first to unblock other work
   - Directly impacts critical path of project

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Enhancement tasks that improve existing functionality
   - Important for project success but not blocking other work
   - To be implemented after high-priority items

3. **Low Priority**
   - Refinement tasks that add polish and advanced capabilities
   - Can be deferred if necessary
   - Scheduled after medium-priority items are complete

### Task Assignment Strategy

1. **Expertise-Based Assignment**
   - Tasks are assigned based on team member expertise and specialization
   - Domain tasks to Domain Specialists, infrastructure tasks to Infrastructure Specialists

2. **Capacity-Based Balancing**
   - Workload is balanced according to team capacity
   - Cross-training is encouraged to build redundancy

3. **Priority-Based Sequencing**
   - High-priority tasks are always addressed before lower priority ones
   - Dependencies are considered when sequencing work

## Development Process

### Sprint Cycle

1. **Sprint Planning**
   - Team selects tasks for upcoming sprint based on priority
   - Tasks are broken down into specific, estimable units
   - Acceptance criteria are defined for all tasks

2. **Daily Standups**
   - 15-minute daily meetings to synchronize team
   - Focus on progress, plans, and impediments
   - Technical discussions deferred to separate meetings

3. **Sprint Review**
   - Demonstration of completed work
   - Gathering feedback from stakeholders
   - Planning adjustments for future sprints

4. **Sprint Retrospective**
   - Review of process effectiveness
   - Identification of improvement opportunities
   - Action items for process refinement

### Code Review Process

1. **Pre-Review Checklist**
