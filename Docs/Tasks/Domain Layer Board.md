# SoftwareEngineerSkills Project - Team Task Organization

## Overview

This document outlines the prioritized tasks for enhancing the SoftwareEngineerSkills project architecture based on our recent analysis. The tasks are organized by priority level to guide implementation sequence and team organization.

## Priority Levels

Tasks are categorized into three priority levels:

- **High Priority**: Foundation tasks that other work depends on - implement these first
- **Medium Priority**: Enhancement tasks to improve existing functionality 
- **Low Priority**: Refinement tasks that add polish and advanced capabilities

## Task Breakdown

### High Priority Tasks (Foundation)

#### 1. Implement Core Domain Layer Components
- **Description**: Create essential building blocks for the domain model
- **Subtasks**:
  - [x] Create `BaseEntity`, `ValueObject`, `AggregateRoot` base classes
  - [x] Implement `IAggregateRoot` interface to clearly identify aggregate boundaries
  - [x] Implement domain invariants with `CheckInvariants`/`EnforceInvariants` pattern
- **Expected Outcome**: Solid foundation for building rich domain models
- **Technical Details**: See Domain Layer Analysis for implementation details
- **Dependencies**: None - this is a foundational task

#### 2. Complete Entity Auditing System
- **Description**: Implement auditing capabilities for entities
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Create interfaces for separation of concerns (`ICreationAuditable`, `IModificationAuditable`)
  - [ ] Implement `IAuditableEntity` interface combining auditing concerns
  - [ ] Implement `ISoftDelete` interface for soft deletion functionality  
  - [ ] Create `SoftDeleteEntity` base class implementing the interface
  - [ ] Create `ICurrentUserService` and implementation for capturing the current user
- **Expected Outcome**: Complete auditing system with creation, modification, and deletion tracking
- **Dependencies**: Depends on Core Domain Layer Components

#### 3. Repository Pattern Implementation
- **Description**: Finalize data access abstractions
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Complete Repository and UnitOfWork interfaces and implementations
  - [ ] Implement specialized repositories for soft-delete entities (`ISoftDeleteRepository<T>`)
  - [ ] Create EF Core extensions for working with soft-deleted entities
  - [ ] Implement global query filters for soft-deleted entities
- **Expected Outcome**: Clean data access layer with proper soft-delete support
- **Dependencies**: Depends on Entity Auditing System

### Medium Priority Tasks (Enhancement)

#### 4. Implement Result Pattern
- **Description**: Create exception-free error handling system
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Create Result classes with success/failure states
  - [ ] Add support for generic result types (`Result<T>`)
  - [ ] Add extension methods for Result operations
  - [ ] Integrate with existing code patterns
- **Expected Outcome**: Cleaner error handling throughout the application
- **Dependencies**: None, but should be applied after High Priority tasks

#### 5. Enhance Value Objects
- **Description**: Improve value object implementations
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Create value objects for domain concepts currently using primitives
  - [ ] Ensure proper immutability in all value objects
  - [ ] Implement proper equality and comparison
  - [ ] Add implicit/explicit operators where appropriate
- **Expected Outcome**: Rich domain model with proper value encapsulation
- **Dependencies**: Core Domain Layer Components

#### 6. Improve Domain Event System
- **Description**: Enhance domain event capabilities
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Implement typed domain events using generics
  - [ ] Add metadata to events (timestamp, correlation ID)
  - [ ] Create domain event dispatchers and handlers
  - [ ] Ensure proper event ordering and handling
- **Expected Outcome**: Robust event-driven architecture
- **Dependencies**: Core Domain Layer Components

### Low Priority Tasks (Refinement)

#### 7. Implement Domain Specifications
- **Description**: Extract business rules to specification classes
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Create `ISpecification<T>` interface
  - [ ] Implement specification classes for common validation rules
  - [ ] Refactor existing validation logic to use specifications
  - [ ] Create composite specifications for complex rules
- **Expected Outcome**: Reusable business rules and improved testability
- **Dependencies**: Core Domain Layer Components

#### 8. Add Policy-Based Entity Access Control
- **Description**: Implement entity-level access control
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Create `IEntityWithAccessControl` interface
  - [ ] Implement access control on relevant entities
  - [ ] Integrate with authorization system
- **Expected Outcome**: Fine-grained access control at the entity level
- **Dependencies**: Core Domain Layer Components

#### 9. Complete IOptions Pattern Implementation
- **Description**: Standardize application configuration
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Standardize settings with section names
  - [ ] Add validation for critical settings
  - [ ] Implement IOptionsMonitor for configuration that may change
- **Expected Outcome**: Type-safe, validated configuration throughout the application
- **Dependencies**: None

## Implementation Guidelines

### Approach
- Start with implementing the high-priority tasks first
- Work on medium-priority tasks only when high-priority ones are complete
- Consider dependencies between tasks when planning work
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each significant change
- Write tests for each implementation

### Documentation
- Document design decisions in architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Update project documentation with new patterns and implementations
- Maintain XML comments on public APIs

## Team Organization Suggestions

### Task Assignment Strategy
- **Core Domain Specialists**: Focus on high-priority domain model tasks
- **Infrastructure Specialists**: Focus on repository and persistence tasks
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns Team**: Work on Result Pattern and IOptions implementation
- **Documentation Team**: Update documentation alongside implementation

### Code Review Process
- All implementations should be reviewed by at least two team members
- High-priority tasks should have more thorough reviews
- Test coverage should be verified during review

## Timeline Considerations

- **High Priority**: Aim to complete within 1-2 weeks
- **Medium Priority**: Target completion within 3-4 weeks after high-priority items
- **Low Priority**: Schedule for completion within 5-6 weeks

## Next Steps

1. Review this task organization document with the team
2. Assign owners to each task area
3. Set up tracking in project management tool
4. Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress
5. Update CHANGELOG.md as items are completed

Remember to continuously update this document as tasks progress or priorities change.
