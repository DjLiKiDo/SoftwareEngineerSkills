A production-ready .NET 9 Web API template implementing enterprise-level best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and secure APIs following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles.

## Project Overview

This project serves as both a **comprehensive enterprise template** and a **practical example** of a development team task board implementation. It demonstrates real-world application of modern software engineering principles through a domain that developers can easily understand and relate to.

### Dual Purpose

**üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Template**
- Production-ready .NET 9 Web API architecture
- Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
- Complete testing strategy and CI/CD pipeline
- Enterprise-grade security, observability, and performance optimization

**üìã Development Team Task Board Example**
- Task management with skill requirements
- Developer profiles with skill capabilities
- Intelligent task-to-developer assignment system
- Hierarchical task structure with subtasks
- Comprehensive workflow state tracking

### Core Domain Features

The system models real-world software development scenarios:

- **Task Management**: Create, organize, and track development tasks with skill requirements
- **Developer Profiles**: Manage team members with their skill sets and proficiency levels
- **Smart Assignment**: Match tasks to developers based on required vs. available skills
- **Workflow States**: Track progress through defined states (To-Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Ready For Release ‚Üí Released)
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Support for parent tasks and subtasks with dependency management
- **Skill Evolution**: Track how developer skills improve over time through task completion

### Why This Domain?

We chose a development team task board because:
- **Familiar Context**: Every developer understands task management and team dynamics
- **Complex Relationships**: Rich domain with entities, value objects, and business rules
- **Real Business Value**: Actual useful functionality for development teams
- **Scalable Complexity**: Can be extended with sprint planning, time tracking, reporting, etc.
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for learning Clean Architecture and DDD patterns

## Domain Example: Task Board

This template demonstrates Clean Architecture and DDD principles through a practical **Development Team Task Board** domain. The implementation showcases how complex business scenarios can be modeled using enterprise-grade patterns.

### Business Domain

The task board system manages the relationship between development tasks and team members:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer] -->|has many| B[Skills]
    C[Task] -->|requires| B[Skills]
    A -->|assigned to| C
    C -->|contains| D[Subtasks]
    C -->|follows| E[Workflow States]
    
    E --> F[To-Do]
    E --> G[In Progress]
    E --> H[Ready For Release]
    E --> I[Released]
```

### Core Entities & Aggregates

**üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Aggregate**
- **Identity**: Unique developer profile
- **Skills**: Collection of technical capabilities with proficiency levels
- **Assignments**: Current and historical task assignments
- **Availability**: Workload and capacity management

**üìã Task Aggregate**
- **Identity**: Unique task identification
- **Requirements**: Skills needed to complete the task
- **Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships for complex work items
- **State Management**: Workflow progression through defined states
- **Assignment Logic**: Rules for matching tasks to developers

**üéØ Skill Value Object**
- **Immutable**: Represents a specific technical capability
- **Categorization**: Groups skills by technology, methodology, or domain
- **Proficiency Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert

### Business Rules Examples

The domain enforces real-world constraints:

- **Skill Matching**: Tasks can only be assigned to developers with required skills
- **Capacity Management**: Developers have maximum concurrent task limits
- **Dependency Validation**: Subtasks cannot be completed before parent tasks
- **State Transitions**: Tasks must follow defined workflow progressions
- **Competency Growth**: Developer skills can improve through task completion

## Project Structure

The solution follows Clean Architecture principles with these main projects:

### Core Layers
- **SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain**: Contains entities, value objects, enums, exceptions, interfaces, and domain events
- **SoftwareEngineerSkills.Application**: Contains business logic, commands/queries (CQRS), validators, and application services
- **SoftwareEngineerSkills.Common**: Contains shared utilities and helpers used across layers

### Infrastructure Layer
- **SoftwareEngineerSkills.Infrastructure**: External service implementations, logging, persistence, repositories, configuration, and other concerns

### API Layer
- **SoftwareEngineerSkills.API**: Controllers, filters, middleware, API versioning, and Swagger configuration

### Tests
- **Unit Tests**: For testing individual components in isolation (one project per layer)
- **Integration Tests**: For testing components across different layers with their dependencies

- **FunctionalTests**: For testing the API endpoints from client perspective

## Design Patterns & Principles

### Clean Architecture
The solution is structured around the dependency rule where dependencies flow inward, with the Domain at the center. External concerns like UI, database, and third-party services are on the outer layers.

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Entities**: Domain objects with identity and lifecycle
  - `BaseEntity`: Base class with ID, versioning, and invariant validation
  - `SoftDeleteEntity`: Extended base class with soft deletion capabilities
- **Value Objects**: Immutable domain objects without identity
  - `ValueObject`: Abstract base class with equality comparison
- **Domain Events**: For side-effect processing
  - Thread-safe implementation with version tracking
- **Aggregates**: Cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit
  - `AggregateRoot`: Base class with domain event handling and boundary enforcement
  - `IAggregateRoot`: Interface defining aggregate responsibilities
- **Invariant Validation**: System to enforce business rules
  - `DomainValidationException`: Exception for invariant violations
  - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous validation

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Commands**: For write operations that change state
- **Queries**: For read operations that return data without changing state
- **MediatR**: Used to dispatch commands and queries

### Repository Pattern
- Abstracts data access
- Provides collection-like interface for domain entities
- Coupled with Unit of Work for transaction management
- Specialized repositories for soft-deletable entities
- EF Core extensions for working with soft-deleted entities

### Entity Auditing System
- `IAuditableEntity`: Interface for tracking entity changes
- Captures creation/modification timestamps and user information
- Soft delete functionality via `ISoftDelete` interface
- Automatic audit property management through DbContext

### Result Pattern
- Eliminates exceptions for expected error paths
- Returns rich result objects with status, errors, and data

## API Documentation

API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger/OpenAPI:

- **Swagger UI**: Available at `/swagger` endpoint
- **API Versioning**: Supports URL path, query string, and header versioning
- **XML Comments**: Used to document API endpoints and models

## Testing

- Real HTTP requests against in-memory test server

## Observability
