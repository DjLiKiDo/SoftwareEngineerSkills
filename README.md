## Overview

This repository provides a production-ready .NET 9 Web API template designed for building scalable, maintainable, and secure enterprise-level applications. It incorporates a comprehensive set of best practices, modern architectural patterns, and industry-standard tools to accelerate development and ensure high-quality results.

The template serves as a robust foundation, emphasizing Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, and a clear separation of concerns.

## Key Features

### Architecture & Design Patterns:
*   **Clean Architecture:** Promotes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability by organizing the codebase into distinct layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API).
*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles:** Focuses on the core domain and domain logic, using entities, aggregates, value objects, and domain services.
*   **Screaming Architecture:** The project structure clearly communicates its intent and business domain.
*   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) with MediatR:** Separates read and write operations, improving performance and scalability. MediatR is used for in-process messaging.
*   **Repository Pattern & Unit of Work:** Abstracts data access logic, providing a consistent way to interact with the data store and manage transactions.
*   **IOptions Pattern:** For strongly-typed configuration management, making it easy to access settings throughout the application.
*   **Result Pattern:** Enables exception-free error handling, improving code clarity and predictability by returning explicit success or failure outcomes.

### Core Technologies:
*   **.NET 9 / ASP.NET Core 9:** Leverages the latest features and performance improvements of the .NET platform.
*   **C# 14+:** Utilizes modern C# language features for concise and expressive code.
*   **Entity Framework Core 9:** Provides powerful data access capabilities with support for LINQ, migrations, and performance optimizations.

### API Documentation & Versioning:
*   **OpenAPI/Swagger with Swashbuckle:** Generates interactive API documentation, making it easy for developers and consumers to understand and test the API.
*   **API Versioning:** Supports multiple API versions to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.

### Testing Framework:
*   **xUnit:** A popular testing framework for writing unit and integration tests.
*   **Moq:** A powerful mocking library for isolating dependencies in unit tests.
*   **FluentAssertions:** Provides a more readable and expressive way to write assertions in tests.
*   **Testcontainers:** Facilitates reliable integration testing by providing ephemeral, dockerized instances of external dependencies (e.g., databases).

### Observability Stack:
*   **Structured Logging with Serilog:** Enables rich, structured logging for better diagnostics and analysis.
*   **OpenTelemetry:** Implements distributed tracing to monitor requests across multiple services.
*   **Health Checks:** Provides endpoints to monitor the health and availability of the API and its dependencies.
*   **Metrics Exposure (Prometheus/AppMetrics):** Exposes application and system metrics for monitoring and alerting.
*   **Correlation ID Tracking:** Ensures traceability of requests throughout the system.

### Security Features:
*   **JWT/OAuth2 Authentication:** Implements robust authentication mechanisms for securing API endpoints.
*   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensures all communication is encrypted.
*   **FluentValidation:** Provides a fluent interface for building strongly-typed validation rules for input DTOs.
*   **CORS Policy Configuration:** Manages cross-origin requests securely.
*   **Secrets Management:** Guidelines and integration points for secure management of sensitive configuration (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, User Secrets).

### Performance Optimizations:
*   **Async/Await Implementation:** Maximizes scalability and responsiveness by using asynchronous programming for I/O-bound operations.
*   **Caching Strategy (In-memory/Redis):** Includes support for caching to improve response times and reduce database load.
*   **Response Compression:** Reduces the size of API responses, improving network performance.
*   **Rate Limiting Middleware:** Protects the API from abuse and ensures fair usage.

### Operational Features:
*   **Dependency Injection:** Extensively used for managing dependencies and promoting loose coupling.
*   **Background Job Processing (e.g., Hangfire/Quartz.NET):** Provides a framework for running background tasks reliably.
*   **Feature Flags Implementation (e.g., FeatureManagement.AspNetCore):** Allows for controlled rollout and testing of new features.
*   **Resilience Patterns with Polly:** Implements retry, circuit breaker, and other resilience patterns to handle transient failures.
*   **Docker Containerization:** Includes a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and deployment.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:** Pre-configured workflow for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Project Structure

The solution follows the principles of Clean Architecture, with a clear separation of concerns:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for Testcontainers and running in a container)
*   An IDE like Visual Studio 2022, JetBrains Rider, or VS Code.

### Setup & Configuration
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Restore dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```
3.  **Configure `appsettings.json`:**
    Update `appsettings.Development.json` (or other environment-specific files) with your local configuration, such as database connection strings and external service keys. For sensitive data, use User Secrets:
    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "your_connection_string"
    # Add other secrets as needed
    ```
4.  **Apply Entity Framework Core Migrations:**
    ```bash
    cd src/SoftwareEngineerSkills.Infrastructure # Or wherever your DbContext project is
    dotnet ef database update -s ../SoftwareEngineerSkills.API # Specify startup project
    ```
    *(Ensure you have the EF Core tools installed: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`)*

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    cd src/SoftwareEngineerSkills.API
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API should now be running, typically at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`. Swagger UI will be available at `/swagger`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```
This command will execute all unit and integration tests in the solution.

## Extending the Template

This template is designed to be a starting point. To adapt it for your specific business requirements:

1.  **Define Your Domain:**
    *   Start by modeling your core domain entities, aggregates, and value objects in the `SoftwareEngineerSkills.Domain` project.
    *   Identify domain events that are significant within your business processes.
2.  **Implement Application Logic:**
    *   Create Commands and Queries (and their Handlers using MediatR) in the `SoftwareEngineerSkills.Application` project to represent use cases.
    *   Define interfaces for any new repository or service abstractions needed.
    *   Implement validation for your request DTOs using FluentValidation.
3.  **Develop Infrastructure:**
    *   Implement repository interfaces in `SoftwareEngineerSkills.Infrastructure` using Entity Framework Core.
    *   Configure your `DbContext` with new entities and relationships.
    *   Create EF Core migrations for schema changes:
        ```bash
        dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> -p ../SoftwareEngineerSkills.Infrastructure -s ../SoftwareEngineerSkills.API
        dotnet ef database update -s ../SoftwareEngineerSkills.API
        ```
    *   Integrate with any external services (e.g., payment gateways, notification services).
4.  **Expose API Endpoints:**
    *   Create new Controllers in `SoftwareEngineerSkills.API` to handle incoming HTTP requests.
    *   Define DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for API requests and responses.
    *   Map requests to application layer commands/queries.
5.  **Add Tests:**
    *   Write unit tests for your domain logic, application services, and API controllers.
    *   Develop integration tests to verify the interaction between different layers and with external dependencies (using Testcontainers where appropriate).
6.  **Configure Services:**
    *   Register your new services, repositories, and handlers in the respective `DependencyInjection.cs` files or in `Program.cs`.

### Best Practices for Extension:
*   **Adhere to Clean Architecture:** Keep dependencies flowing inwards (API -> Application -> Domain). Infrastructure implements interfaces defined in Application or Domain.
*   **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles in your design.
*   **Keep Controllers Thin:** Controllers should primarily delegate to the application layer.
*   **Use the Result Pattern:** For all operations that can fail, return a `Result` object from your application services.
*   **Secure Your Endpoints:** Apply appropriate authentication and authorization.
*   **Document Your API:** Ensure Swagger documentation is updated with new endpoints and DTOs (use XML comments).
