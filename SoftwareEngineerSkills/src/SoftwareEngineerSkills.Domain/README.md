# Domain Layer

## Overview

The domain layer is the core of the SoftwareEngineerSkills application. It contains all the business entities, value objects, and domain logic that represent the business model.

This layer follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and serves as the heart of the Clean Architecture implementation.

## Getting Started

To work on the domain layer:

1. Start by reviewing the [Domain-Development-Board.md](../Docs/Tasks/Domain-Development-Board.md) document
2. Refer to the [Domain-Implementation-Recommendations.md](../Docs/Domain/Domain-Implementation-Recommendations.md) for code patterns
3. Check the [Domain-Layer-Tasks.md](../Docs/Tasks/Domain-Layer-Tasks.md) for specific tasks

## Key Components

- **Aggregates**: Domain entities that form aggregate roots
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes
- **Domain Events**: Events that represent important domain occurrences
- **Domain Services**: Services that operate on multiple aggregates
- **Exceptions**: Domain-specific exceptions

## Folder Structure

```

└── ValueObjects/               <- Value objects used in the domain
```

## Coding Standards

When working on the domain layer, follow these principles:

1. **Rich Domain Model**: Domain entities should encapsulate both data and behavior
2. **Encapsulation**: Use private setters and expose behavior through methods
3. **Immutability**: Value objects should be immutable
4. **Validation**: Domain entities should validate their invariants
5. **Event-Driven**: Use domain events to handle side effects

See the [Domain-Code-Improvements.md](../Docs/Domain/Domain-Code-Improvements.md) document for detailed coding standards.
